<h2> Distributed Image Processing in Cloud Dataproc Qwiklabs </h2>
In this Qwiklab, Apache Spark on Cloud Dataproc was used to distribute a computationally intensive image processing task onto a cluster of machines. The end result is accurately processed face detection of 3 separate photos. The before and after can be found in the "images" folder.
